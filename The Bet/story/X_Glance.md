# Lost Interaction
The following is from an interaction between Monica and Sophia.


She cursed loudly. “The house always wins,” Monica muttered.

“Aw, don’t be like that,” I told her, eyes flicking back to my newest visitor. “Last time you won a hundred grand like it was nothing. I’m just evening out the score, fifty grand at a time.”

She smiled back. “Yeah, suppose so. Now that was a good game.”

I chuckled and started collecting my winnings. “If you say so. Now, ladies and gents, I think I’m going to bow out. I need to greet my newest guests.”

“Ooh, a math genius, I’ll bet,” Monica said with a smile. “Best be careful, Sophia, or he’ll skin you alive.”

“Nah, I think he’s doing physics?” The guy from earlier said, as though it mattered. I could work out probabilities like it was nothing, and beyond that most card games boiled down to money and lies.

“I’m touched by your concern, Monica. You are such a good friend,” I replied.

She shrugged. “Compassion is my middle name.”

That Harvard bitch had enough dirt on half of her professors to get automatic A’s on everything she did. Still, it takes one to know one. I shook my head in amusement and left her to clean out the table.
