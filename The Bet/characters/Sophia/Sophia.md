First person narrator and protagonist, Sophia is a 20 year old student hosting an illegal gambling ring in Cambridge, MA, frequented by the young and rich of Harvard, MIT, etc.

Sophia is an expert gambler herself, but she knows the game is rigged. She learned various cards games at a young age, as well as various techniques for cheating (actual cheating or advantage playing).

Sophia views gambling as a family business. She might say that her [[heritage|“parents own the second largest gambling empire in the world.”]]

But she doesn’t say it much. Machiavellian, cunning, and ruthless – she trusts very few people with any important information.

Sophia is attending Harvard, studying for an MBA. She is not technically the heir of the “gambling empire,” but she is expected to join it in some fashion like the rest of the family.

For reasons best known to herself, she has been enacting a plan of her own, using her gambling ring to gain influence and blackmail over students that might – in the future – become politicians and leaders.
