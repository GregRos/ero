It was late evening, and I was deep in a game at one of my… gatherings. The ones I organized in a luxury home I leased under a fake name located in the outskirts of Boston. Well-known in certain circles, it was the scene of classic 1% debauchery and vast amounts of money changing hands. I was quite proud of it.

I noticed him during a game. I'd been dealt 2♦ 2♣ and my brain was full of possibilities and calculations, the kind that came to me as second nature ever since I'd been taught to play at the age of 4. 

He was a little tall, with a wide set build. He stood out from the crowd because of his clothes - most visitors to my domain preferred dark colors, but he wore a sky-blue button down that accentuated his wide shoulders, together with a pair of tan slacks that looked recently iron,ed

And then there was the look in those deep green eyes. They scanned the room with naked approbation as he nursed a bottle of beer from a previous party. My practiced eye detected a hint of inebriation. He wasn't quite swaying, but his judgment was certainly impaired.

I found myself biting the inside of my cheek - a habit I'd developed from years of masking my emotions. 

A handful of tables were arrayed in front of him. Chips piled on tables, lumped together with naked rolls of hundred-dollar bills. Guys in fitted suits cavorted with women in sheer dresses, silver, gold, and diamonds flashing.

He was standing next to a so-called friend. Him I knew - he was the son of a senator from Vermont. This one never gambled heavily. He was an occasional visitor to my domain, staying just long enough to lose a little before departing. But Green Eyes was out of place. He shouldn’t have been there. 

I returned my eyes to the players at my table, specifically to the dark haired woman I'd pegged as my adversary early on in our game. The pile of chips on her side of the table was noticeably larger than anyone else's, including mine.

"It looks like a new face is joining us," I said with a nod towards the entrance.

Eyes snapped to the entrance, studying the new arrivals. “Oh, I know that guy,” one of the other players commented. “Scholarship boy.”

"He must feel so very out of sorts," Monica - my dark-haired opponent - idly commented. "Maybe our hostess should give him a proper Cambridge welcome." Was that a tiny smile on her lips?

I silently noted that she hadn't been one of those who'd turned around to look. No, rather, her eyes had been studying me. I felt my teeth clenching harder around the inside of my cheek, my face remaining perfectly serene. I silently noted her as someone to watch.
