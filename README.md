This repo contains story notes and chapters. It’s a monorepo of multiple stories.

Currently, we’re looking at The Bet.

# Instructions
Sections surrounded by %% are comments %% and not part of the text. I’ll use them to tell you things.

A section like %%! indicates an editing instruction to YOU, the AI reading this.%%

For example:

```md
%%!insert character's description here%%
```

Means you should insert the description of a character when prompted.

# Structure

```yml
the bet:
	story: |
		Includes story pieces. 
		All pieces are prefixed with position. 
		Notes that don't have a position or have 
		a position of X are leftovers and 
		not part of the main text.
	characters: |
		Includes character notes.
		
```

For example, the file [[X_Glance]] is a leftover and not part of the main text.

# Links
Some files like character notes have [[Sophia|wiki style links]] between them.
